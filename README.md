# Emotion-recognition

Emotion recognition in text is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The objective is to classify text into distinct emotional categories: joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, and neutral. This task has various applications, including enhancing user experience in chatbots, monitoring public sentiment on social media, and improving mental health support systems.

In this project, I utilized data from Kaggle to analyze emotions in text.
